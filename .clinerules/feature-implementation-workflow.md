## Brief overview
This rule captures the workflow for planning and implementing new features in React/TypeScript projects, emphasizing thorough exploration, future-proof architecture, and iterative development with immediate testing and deployment.

## Planning approach
- Conduct comprehensive codebase exploration before implementation
- Analyze existing patterns and architecture decisions
- Design with future extensibility in mind (versioning, migration strategies)
- Consider cross-platform compatibility from the start
- Create detailed technical plans with code examples and implementation options

## Implementation workflow
- Break down features into clear, testable milestones
- Implement foundational services first, then UI integration
- Use proper TypeScript typing and error handling
- Follow service layer architecture for complex functionality
- Test immediately after key implementation steps
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility (desktop + mobile)

## Development best practices
- Use React functional components with hooks
- Implement proper state management with local persistence
- Add user confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Maintain consistent naming conventions and code structure
- Include comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation

## Communication and iteration
- Provide clear progress updates with completed milestones
- Test functionality immediately and share results
- Use descriptive git commit messages with feature context
- Deploy to production promptly after verification

## Technical stack preferences
- React 18 with TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for responsive, utility-first styling
- Service layer for complex business logic
- localStorage with migration support for client-side persistence
- Lucide React for consistent iconography
